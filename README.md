Location based alarm system

This application features the location-based alarm system. This app uses the Google maps API and geofencing to trigger alert to the user. This location-based alarm system helps the user by alerting them well in advance about when he/she is going to reach the destination as the user may be busy doing something while in the public transport or maybe traveling to some unknown location. This application will really help the people who use to travel a lot and will make their life a bit easy.
